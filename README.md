# virtualTouchpad

virtualTouchpad is a Windows 7, Windows 8(.1), Windows 10 (or later) program for use on Windows tablets or convertibles with touch screens. 

Windows 8.1, Windows 10 touch screens, especially on tablets, do not work well with many standard windows programs and websites; especially those that use roll-over effects like menu buttons and tool tips. Resizing Windows and scrolling is frustratingly difficult on Windows tablet touch screens and small icons and buttons often require the use of a stylus and even then they don't always work as they should.

virtualTouchpad solves all these problems by making your touch screen into a track-pad that controls a standard cursor. At last your Windows tablet has a cursor and you can position it exactly where you need to have it - without your finger blocking the target - and mouse roll over effects work perfectly on menus and buttons of all Windows programs and websites. 

Install this small, free program and you'll be able to use your Windows tablet much more efficiently with no stylus. You can customize it in a number of ways to suit your own preferences.
